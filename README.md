## 💡 Idea Description

### Problem 1: Traffic Monitoring and Analysis

- **🗺️ Integration of Map Engines and Drones**  
  Uses map services and drone footage for real-time traffic assessment from both aerial and ground-level perspectives.

- **🚗 Lane-Wise Vehicle Detection**  
  Object detection models are applied to drone video to mark lanes and count vehicles, enabling analysis of traffic flow patterns.

- **🔄 Comparison with Real-Time API Data**  
  Vehicle counts and congestion data (in CSV format) are compared with live traffic data from APIs (e.g., TOMTOM) for accuracy validation.

- **📊 Historical Data Logging**  
  Traffic logs are stored locally or in a serverless database to maintain historical records for future reference and trend analysis.

### Problem 3: Bottleneck Detection and Alert System

- **📍 Identification of Bottlenecks**  
  Detects issues like illegal parking, road encroachments, and poor road conditions using object detection on video footage.

- **🧠 Model Training & Dataset Generation**  
  Annotated frames from footage are used to create custom datasets and train object detection models for bottleneck factors.

- **⚠️ Benchmarking & Alerts**  
  Area-specific congestion benchmarks are defined. If traffic exceeds these thresholds, alerts are sent to authorities via messaging services to prompt action.
